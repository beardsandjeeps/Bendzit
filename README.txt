Tube Bend Calculator — v5 (3D + STL/GLB export)

• Multi-tube scene with per‑tube color, position, rotation.
• 3D preview (Three.js), solid tube sweep along centerline.
• STL export (current tube) and GLB export (all tubes).
• Manual or target hints per bend (enter optional X/Y targets; see suggested straight‑after via hover—internal fields).
• Works offline as a PWA.

Note: Browser STEP export requires heavy CAD kernels. For STEP, we recommend exporting STL/GLB from the app and converting to STEP in CAD, or we can later add a WASM-based CAD kernel.
